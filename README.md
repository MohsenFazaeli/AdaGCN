# Reference Code for ICLR-21 paper "AdaGCN: Adaboosting Graph Convolutional Networks into Deep Models"

Please refer to [openreview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QkRbdiiEjM) (ICLR 2021) to look into the details of our paper.

We are still sorting out our source code, but we strongly recommend you to firstly refer to **Predict then Propagate: Graph Neural Networks meet Personalized PageRank** (ICLR 2019) github: https://github.com/klicperajo/ppnp, since our code is directly adapted from this paper.  Before the final release of our code, you can try your ideas based on this code and compare results with us shown in our paper directly.
